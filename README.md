# About the Project
The project helps reduce wastage of food and increase the mobility and management over food. It is basically for supervision of food in granaries or cold storage to prevent damage and have easy access over food information(details like harvest day, possible expiration, cost price, possible selling price). For small grainery owners it can save a lot of money as sometimes product brought for more is sold for cheaper due to mismanagement. A remote website with all the information of stock can help in seamless trade and save resources.
